# Share Price Ticker

This is nothing more than a first objective c project for me.

This attempts to be a share price ticker that sits in the Status Bar on MAC OS X and updates at regular intervals.

I'm using this project to get into objective c and therefore I plan to add features to this as and when I learn.
